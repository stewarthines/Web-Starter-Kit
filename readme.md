# My Personal Design System
I built this project as a starter kit for my web projects. It's a design system I've made from scratch. The goal is to have a starting point for WordPress and Jekyll sites. Someday, I want to convert this to work for web apps as well.

## Goals:
- Responsive & Adaptive, working on all devices
- Bring consistency and speed to my personal work flow. 
- Be customizable enough to work to build websites with WordPress and Jekyll
- Be easy enough to use to build web applications and mobile applications. 

## Whats Here:
This project contains styles and scripts for websites. There are four layouts available: 
### Views
- `home.html` is a homepage layout. 
- `page.html` is a generic page layout. 
- `list.html` is a list view.
- `post.html` is viewing a single piece of content; a blog post. 

### Styles
- `master.scss` imports all the style files

Github really screwed me up with the new "main" branch and pushing me to master. It pushed files i didn't want pushed, it ignored my gitignore file... i dunno... i'm frustrated.
